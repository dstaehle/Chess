A modern, browser-based Chess960 game with visual overlays that show which squares are influenced by which pieces — built as a learning exercise in clean code, SVG rendering, and advanced chess rules.

## Features

- Influence overlays (blue for white, red for black, purple when contested)  
- En passant, castling (Chess960 logic), and pawn promotion support  
- Last move highlighting and click-to-move UI  
- Clean code structure and modular SVG rendering

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess960-influence.git
